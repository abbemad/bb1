             <p> A planet is an astronomical body orbiting a star or stellar remnant that is massive enough to 
                be rounded by its own gravity, is not massive enough to cause thermonuclear fusion, and has cleared 
                its neighbouring region of planetesimals.</p>

                <div class="content-text">
                    <p> The term planet is ancient, with ties to history, astrology, science, mythology, 
                        and religion. Several planets in the Solar System can be seen with the naked eye. 
                        These were regarded by many early cultures as divine, or as emissaries of deities.
                        As scientific knowledge advanced, human perception of the planets changed, incorporating
                        a number of disparate objects. In 2006, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) officially 
                        adopted a resolution defining planets within the Solar System 
                        This definition is controversial because it excludes many objects of planetary mass based on where or what they orbit</p>

                <h2 class="content-title">What about space</h2>
                    <p>Space is the three-dimensional extension in which all things exist and move. 
                        Intuitively, it feels that we live in an unchanging space. In this space, 
                        the height of a tree or the length of a table is exactly the same for everybody. 
                        Einstein's special theory of relativity explains that this intuitive feeling is really an illusion. 
                        Neither space nor time is the same for two people moving relative to each other. Only a combination of space and time, 
                        called space-time, is unchanged for everyone. Einstein's general theory of relativity states that the force of gravity is a result 
                        of a warping of this space-time by heavy objects, such as planets. According to the Big Bang theory of the origin of the universe, 
                        the expansion of the universe began from infinitely curved space-time. Scientists still do not know whether 
                        this expansion will continue indefinitely, or whether the universe will collapse again in a Big Crunch. 
                        Meanwhile, astronomers are continually learning about outer space from terrestrial and orbiting telescopes, 
                        space probes sent to other planets in the solar system , and other scientific observations. 
                        This is just the beginning of the exploration of the unimaginably vast void, beyond Earth's outer atmosphere, 
                        in which a journey to the nearest star would take 3,000 years traveling at a million miles per hour.</p>

                    <p>It is the only private company ever to return a spacecraft from low-Earth orbit, 
                        which it first accomplished in December 2010. 
                        The company made history again in May 2012 when its Dragon spacecraft delivered cargo to and from the 
                        International Space Station â€” a challenging feat previously accomplished only by governments.
                        Since then Dragon has delivered cargo to and from the space station multiple times,
                        providing regular cargo resupply missions for NASA.
